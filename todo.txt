Feb 2, 2018 - Front-End Todo
TODO - (in collaboration w/ Mitchell)
  - Generate a new part rather than drag and drop
  - Turn boxes into svgs of parts; simple enough, just substitution (?)
  - Snap to grid? Draggables have a "grid" option, though you did say snap might be a
    bad idea, some minimal grid snapping would be useful (smaller grid-pixel snap size)
  - Plan UI; when you click on a part, what are the options? Sketch out ideas
    - Rotate, delete, flip, highlight current image
        - Not needed right now; change where part name is shown? Infobox options
        - Flipping things MIGHT have complications; not a perfect flip
            - Make copies of certain things?
    - See Mitchell's sketch for ideas?
    - Can either be on the top (toolbar) or around currently selected component
        - More options possible?
